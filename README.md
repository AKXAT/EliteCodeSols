# Soltest -> ONLY PYTHON SOLUTIONS


### Intoduction -> 
1. This Project is all about creating best solutions to all programming questions and then writing tests for the solutions. This is meant to add more questions and solutions whihc may or maynot be avaliable on many competative website. 

2. The Solutions should be by default written in the ./Solutions Folder and the Test should be writter under ./Tests folder. 

3. Test should be written using pytest and should follow the common guidelines of pytest. The results/artifacts should be ignored while the code is being comitted. 

### Setup 

1. Once you clone the project use the command '''make run''' to setup your virtural enviornment.
2. Once the step 1 is done , you might want to create a new branch or work on already existing branch. 
3. Branches are setup topic wise. (#example -> switch to array branch to work on the questions and tests)
4. In case creating a new branch, it is recommended to name the branch as per a topic (for example -> you wante to create new branch related to lists -> use the command '''git checkout -b lists''' and then perform the step1)


# THIS IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT

# LeetCode - Array

### About 

- An array in python is defined as a container that stores the collection of items at contiguous memory locations. The items that are stored in the array should be of the same type. Python arrays are dynamic. As we know that arrays in python are mutable which means we can change the original array at any point in time.


### How would you create an Array 

- A list is an array

```
mylist = [1,2,3,4]
```

- array pakage 

```
from array import *

#how you would create an array
array()
```
